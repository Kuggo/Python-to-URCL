# Python-to-URCL
Compiler from python 2 to URCL using python!
Basic math interpreter for expressions, variable assignments, and conditions. It will include loops and float support later as soon as those are a definitive feature in URCL
No support for python libraries nor specific features when addressing strings nor other unlisted features.
Variable assignment
Control flow and loops
functions and calls
Float as variable (as soon as those are on URCL++)
string methods (as soon as they are updated to URCL++)
other missing features wont work, but the compiler wont stop working if fed some of these keywords (it will just not read that part)
